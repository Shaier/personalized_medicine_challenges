She has been worrying non-stop recently about the possibility that her partner will lose their job as a teacher. Her partner, who is present, assures the physician that their job is entirely secure and states that she has \"fretted\" for their entire marriage, though the exact topic causing her anxiety varies over time. She also worries excessively about everyday tasks, such as whether she will catch the train on time and whether their house in Southern California is sufficiently earthquake-proof. She has no way to overcome these worries.

She has not experienced asthma symptoms for the last 2 months and there is no history of non-compliance. She mentions that her present symptoms came on about 20 minutes after her last meal. When the doctor makes specific inquiries, she recollects items in her lunch, which included canned milk product, commercially available roasted peanuts, homemade celery salad, and wine. She also mentions that she took a tablet of acetaminophen immediately after the meal because her legs were aching since morning, which she attributes to her morning walk at 6 am the same day. She has never developed respiratory symptoms in response to milk protein, peanuts, or acetaminophen until now. Skin prick testing for food allergens, performed a month back, was negative for all the common food allergens, including milk and peanuts.
